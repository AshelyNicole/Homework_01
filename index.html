            <p>Hi Hi! Thanks for stopping by! My name Ashely Rumbaoa. I'm a foodie, adventure/travel/discomfort seeker and future webdeveloper from Hawaii. I originally graduated with a B.S. in International Business at Azusa Pacific University. My journey to becoming a web developer has been a colorful one. Since graduating, I've worn many hats: Travel Agent, Sales and Marketing Specialist, Assistant to a Director of the AV department at a luxury hotel, Assistant Event Planner, Postmates Deliverer, and now an Executive Assistant for a luxury cruise line. Where does my interest in web development come in? </p>

            <p>My first taste of basic HTML was during the days of Xanga. Did I just age myself? Ohh well. It wasn't till I started working at the Computer Repair Center where I was exposed to the IT world and became interested in fixing computers, and learning how to code. After graduating, I did what most do, find a job that is related to my degree. My love for technology has only grown, and a few months ago was presented the perfect opportunity to pursue my curiosity of becoming a web developer. A opportunity too hard not to take.</p>
